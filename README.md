# survey on handheld processors
A processor is an integrated electronic circuit(IC) that performs arithmetical, logical, input and output and other basic instructions. These instructions are passed from an operating system. A processor basically includes a ALU and CU. In simple words it is a small chip that processes smart devices such as tablets, mobile, etc. Processors can be categorized into single core and multi core processors. Now a days they are further classified as dual core, triple core, quad core and octa core. Which means these processors can run two CPU's that is Dual core, three CPU's that is Triple core, four CPU’s that is Quad core and eight CPU’s that is Octa core. Processors today are mostly multi-core that helps in enhanced performance, low power consumption and efficient parallel processing of tasks.
